	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>I'm currently working as a senior data scientist/software developer at IBM Watson Assistant. I focus on machine learning algorithms for IBM Watson Assistant conversational language understanding. Most recently I have been working on irrelevance detection algorithms for task oriented dialog systems, training orchestration and runtime for <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-autolearn">Autolearn</a>. I am interested in applications of NLP/NLU and its theories.
