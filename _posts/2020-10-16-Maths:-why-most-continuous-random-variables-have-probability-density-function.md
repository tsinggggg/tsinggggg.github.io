Continuous random variables that are not absolutely continuous are rare. While it doesn't really answer the question, but i think it's interesting that there's the connection(which is proved in Nielsen, Ole A. (1997), An introduction to integration and measure theory, Wiley-Interscience, ISBN 0-471-59518-7) between absolutely continuous functions and absolutely continuous measures. There's also a [Relationship between Radon-Nikodym derivative and classical derivative](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/tag/absolute-continuity/) by Terence Tao)
